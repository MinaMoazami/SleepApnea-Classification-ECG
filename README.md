# Sleep Apnea Classification using Deep Learning on ECG Signals

This repository contains the implementation and results of my Master's thesis:
**"Sleep Apnea Classification using Deep Learning Algorithm"**  
submitted to the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Winter 2023.

## üìò Thesis Overview

Sleep apnea is a prevalent disorder with serious health implications. This work proposes a deep learning approach to classify:
- Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
- Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)
- Mixed Sleep Apnea (MSA)
- Normal Breathing

The model is trained solely on ECG signals using HRV and EDR features with an LSTM-based neural network.

## üî¨ Method

This study uses publicly available polysomnography datasets to extract single-lead ECG signals. The methodology includes:

- **Signal Processing:** Extracting HRV (Heart Rate Variability) and EDR (ECG-Derived Respiration) features from filtered ECG signals using NeuroKit2.
- **Segmentation:** Dividing signals into 60-second non-overlapping epochs with corresponding apnea labels.
- **Feature Engineering:** Time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear HRV features were combined with EDR patterns.
- **Modeling:** A stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was designed to learn temporal dynamics and classify each epoch into:
  - Normal Breathing
  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
  - Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)
  - Mixed Sleep Apnea (MSA)

## üìä Results

The proposed model achieved high performance on multi-class classification tasks using ECG data alone:

| Metric     | Value    |
|------------|----------|
| Precision  | 0.721    |
| Recall     | 0.709    |
| F1 Score   | 0.699    |
| AUC (avg.) | 0.894    |

Class-wise performance showed that the model performs best for distinguishing **Normal** and **OSA** events, with slightly lower precision on **MSA** due to class imbalance.
